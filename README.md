A repo for synthesis of microdata tax data from the SOI public use file (PUF). The repo has separate programs that:
1. Prepare data for synthesis
2. Synthesize PUF data using R package synthpop (other steps can work with files synthesized in other ways)
3. Evaluate unweighted synfile quality
4. Privacy analysis
5. Weight the synthesized data
6. Evaluate weighted file quality
