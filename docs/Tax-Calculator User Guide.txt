Tax-Calculator User Guide
This document tells you how to use Tax-Calculator, an open-source federal income and payroll tax simulation model. The two ways of using Tax-Calculator described here require no computer programming. If you are interested in Python programming with Tax-Calculator, you should read the tested recipes in our Tax-Calculator Cookbook. If you want ask a question, report a bug or request an enhancement, do that by creating a new issue at the Tax-Calculator website.

Please cite the source of your analysis as Tax-Calculator release #.#.#, author's calculations. If you wish to link to Tax-Calculator, this page is preferred. Additionally, we strongly recommend that you describe the input data used, and provide a link to the materials required to replicate your analysis or, at least, note that those materials are available upon request.

TaxBrain GUI
You can use Tax-Calculator via a graphical user interface (GUI) provided by the TaxBrain web application. This approach requires only an Internet connection and web browser on your computer. TaxBrain (TB) uses a micro dataset to produce both aggregate and distributional reform estimates for each of ten years for a tax reform you specify. The calculations take just a couple of minutes and there is flexibility to show different kinds of distributional results as well as aggregate revenue results.

Specify Tax Reform
The first step in using TaxBrain is to set the Start Year for the tax calculations. Then specify the values of policy parameters that you want to change in your reform.

By default the policy parameter boxes contain Start Year values. Simply replace the current-law value with the Start Year reform value. If some or all of your reform provisions are going to begin after the Start Year, simply fill in the pre-reform years with asterisks. So, for example, if Start Year is 2017 and your reform calls for raising the social security payroll tax rate to 13 percent in 2018 and then to 14 percent in 2020, you would enter in that box the following:

*,0.13,*,0.14
This parameter is not indexed, so the 0.13 value for 2018 will be extrapolated to 2019, and the 0.14 value for 2020 will be in force in all subsequent years.

Initiate Static Analysis
Simply click on the Show me the results! button to start the tax calculations. That button will use the full sample and take a couple of minutes to compute revenue and distributional results for each of ten years beginning with the Start Year you specified.

There is also a Quick Calculation! button that produces results only for the Start Year using a sub-sample of the full sample.

Back to Section Contents

View/Download Static Results
After the tax calculations are completed, you are shown a results page that presents various options: you can specify, view and download a total liabilities table, your can specify, view and download a distribution table, you can use your reform to conduct different types of dynamic analysis (via the button labeled Link to Dynamic Simulations), and finally, you can go back to the policy parameters page to modify your reform (via the button labeled Edit Parameters).

There are three variants of the total liabilities table. The variant shown initially is Change, meaning the amounts are the difference between liabilities under your reform and the liabilities projected for current-law policy. You can also elect to see the reform and current-law levels.

There are many variants of the distribution table. Try clicking on the options to the left to define the nature of the table and the year for which it is constructed. Try clicking on the options to the right to specify which columns are included in the table. An easy way to uncheck all the column boxes is to double click on the Select All box.

There are three download options for each of these two tables:

Print creates a new page in your browser that is suitable for printing.

Copy puts the table on the clipboard of your local computer so that you can paste it anywhere on your computer. The copy on the clipboard uses invisible tab characters to separate the table's columns.

CSV downloads to your computer a CSV-formatted file containing the information in the table. CSV-formatted files can be easily imported into any spreadsheet program.

Back to Section Contents

Initiate Dynamic Analysis
After clicking on the Link to Dynamic Simulations on the static results page, you are presented with a page that allows you to choose different types of dynamic simulations to conduct on your tax reform:

Partial Equilibrium Simulation is described this way: This approach answers the question, how would taxpayer behavior (income and deductions) affect revenue if all other prices in the economy could stay the same?

Overlapping Generations Simulation is described this way: This approach answers the question, how does tax policy affect macroeconomic aggregates and prices?

Clicking on one of these choices will allow you to specify some additional economic assumption parameters and initiate the dynamic analysis using your economic assumptions.

tc CLI
You can use Tax-Calculator on your own computer via a command line interface (CLI) called tc. This approach requires the installation of Anaconda Python and the taxcalc package on your computer as well as the use of a text editor to prepare simple files that are read by tc. Computer programming knowledge is not required, but if you are prevented from doing the easy installation or you are not willing to work at the command line (Terminal on Mac or Command Prompt on Windows) and use an editor (for example, TextEdit on Mac or Notepad on Windows), then you should probably use the TaxBrain GUI.

If you are comfortable using an editor to prepare text files that describe your tax reforms, but don't want to install Python and tc on your computer, you can upload reform files to TaxBrain where all the analysis is conducted (as described in the previous section). If you are interested in this file-upload approach, skip the first part of this section, read the next part on how to specify policy reform files, and then skip to the last part of this section on how to upload files to TaxBrain.

Install/Test tc CLI
Installation of tc CLI involves several steps:

Install the free Anaconda Python distribution by going to the Anaconda download page and selecting Python 3.6 or Python 3.7. You should install Python 3.6+ because we have discontinued support for Python 2.7. You must do this installation even if you already have Python installed on your computer because the Anaconda distribution contains all the additional Python packages that Tax-Calculator uses to conduct tax calculations (many of which are not included in other Python installations). You can install the Anaconda distribution without having administrative privileges on your computer and the Anaconda distribution will not interfere with any Python installation that came as part of your computer’s operating system.

Check your Anaconda Python installation by entering the following two commands at the operating system command prompt (which is shown as $ here, but would be > on Windows) in any directory:

$ conda --version
Expected output is something like conda 4.5.11
$ python --version
Expected output should contain the Python 3.6 or the Python 3.7 phrase as well as the Anaconda phrase, the presence of which confirm that the installation went smoothly.
Install the free taxcalc package by entering the following:

$ conda install -c PSLmodels taxcalc
Expected output should contain information about all the additional packages that Tax-Calculator needs. After all that information has been shown on the screen, press the y key to proceed with the package installation.
Check your installation of tc (the CLI to Tax-Calculator) by entering the following:

$ tc --test
Expected output (after about twenty seconds) is PASSED TEST. If you get FAILED TEST, something went wrong in the installation process. If the installation test fails, please report your experience by creating a new issue at this website or by sending an email to one of the core maintainers of Tax-Calculator listed at the bottom of the What is TaxBrain? page at this website.
If your installation passes the test, you are ready to begin using tc to analyze your tax reforms. Continue reading this section for information about how to do that. But if you want a quick hint about the range of tc capabilities, enter the following:

$ tc --help
After you have installed the taxcalc package, keep it up to date by checking for new releases at this page and, when there is a new release, executing this command:

$ conda update -c PSLmodels taxcalc
The packages are usually available about an hour after the release.
The basic idea of tc tax analysis is that each tax reform is specified in a text file using a simple method to describe the details of the reform. Read the next part of this section to see how policy reform files are formatted.

Back to Section Contents

Specify Tax Reform
The details of a tax reform are contained in a text file that you write with a text editor. The reform is expressed by specifying which tax policy parameters are changed from their current-law values by the reform. The timing and magnitude of these policy parameter changes are written in JSON, a simple and widely-used data-specification language.

For several examples of reform files and the general rules for writing JSON reform files, go to this page.

If you want to upload a reform file to TaxBrain for static analysis (rather than use the tc CLI on your computer for analysis), go to this section's last part, which discusses uploading files to TaxBrain. If you want to assume any responses to your tax reform (that is, if you want to conduct non-static analysis), read the next part before going to the last part.

Back to Section Contents

Specify Analysis Assumptions
This part explains how to specify economic assumption files used in non-static tax analysis. If you want to start out doing static analysis, you can skip this part now and come back to read it whenever you want to go beyond static analysis. The next part of this section discusses filing-unit input files.

The details of economic assumptions are contained in a text file that you write with a text editor. The assumptions are expressed by specifying which parameters are changed from their default values, all of which are zero. The timing and magnitude of these parameter changes are written in JSON, a simple and widely-used data-specification language.

For examples of economic assumption files and the general rules for writing JSON assumption files, go to this page.

If you want to upload policy reform and economic assumption files to TaxBrain, you can go directly to this section's last part, which discusses uploading files to TaxBrain. If you want to analyze your tax reforms on your own computer, go to the next part on how to specify tax filing units used in the analysis.

Back to Section Contents

Specify Filing Units
The taxcalc package containing the tc CLI to Tax-Calculator does not include the microsimulation sample used by TaxBrain. This is because, unlike Census survey public-use files, the IRS-SOI Public Use File (PUF) is proprietary. If you or your organization has paid IRS to use the PUF version being used by TaxBrain, then it may be possible for us to share with you our TaxBrain sample, which we call puf.csv even though it contains CPS records that represent non-filers. Otherwise, you have three choices.

First, you can easily create with an editor a CSV-formatted file containing several filing units whose experience under your tax reform is of interest to you. Much of the public discussion of tax reforms is of this type: how is this family or that family affected by a reform; how do they fare under different reforms; etc. Notice that this kind of analysis of a few exemplary families is something you cannot do on TaxBrain. The test conducted to check the tc installation has left one such file. It is called test.csv and contains two filing units with only wage and salary income: a lower income family and a higher income family. You can use the test.csv file as tc input to analyze your tax reforms. Before creating your own input files be sure to read the short set of guidelines that appear after this list of three choices.

Second, recently we made freely available a public-use file containing only filing units derived from several recent March CPS surveys. For several reasons, the results generated by this cps.csv file are substantially different from the results generated by the puf.csv file. The cps.csv file contains a sample of the population while the puf.csv file contains mostly a sample of income tax filers in which high-income filing units are over represented. Also, the cps.csv file has many income variables that are missing (and assumed to be zero by Tax-Calculator), which causes an understating of total incomes, especially for those with high incomes. All these differences mean that the aggregate revenue and distributional results generated when using the cps.csv file as input to Tax-Calculator can be substantially different from the results generated when using the puf.csv file as input. And this is particularly true when analyzing reforms that change the tax treatment of high-income filers.

Third, when you want to estimate how your reform affects total tax liabilities and/or the distribution of tax liabilities, you can always upload your policy reform and economic assumption files to TaxBrain. Combining this option with the first option provides a complete tax analysis capability. The last part of this section describes how to upload files to TaxBrain.

Input-File-Preparation Guidelines

The tc CLI to Tax-Calculator is flexible enough to read almost any kind of CSV-formatted input data on filing units as long as the variable names correspond to those expected by Tax-Calculator. The only required input variables are RECID (a unique filing-unit record identifier) and MARS (a positive-valued filing-status indicator). Other variables in the input file must have variable names that are listed in the Input Variables section for them to affect the tax calculations. Any variable listed in Input Variables that is not in an input file is automatically set to zero for every filing unit. Variables in the input file that are not listed in Input Variables are ignored by Tax-Calculator.

However, there are important data-preparation issues related to the fact that the payroll tax is a tax on individuals, not on income-tax filing units. Tax-Calculator expects that the filing-unit total for each of several earnings-related variables is split between the taxpayer and the spouse. It is the responsibility of anyone preparing data for Tax-Calculator input to do this earnings splitting. Here are the relationships between the filing-unit variable and the taxpayer (p) and spouse (s) variables expected by Tax-Calculator:

e00200 = e00200p + e00200s
e00900 = e00900p + e00900s
e02100 = e02100p + e02100s
Obviously, when MARS is not equal to 2 (married filing jointly), the values of the three s variables are zero and the value of each p variable is equal to the value of its corresponding filing-unit variable. Note that the input file can omit any one, or all, of these three sets variables. If the three variables in one of these sets are omitted, the required relationship will be satisfied because zero equals zero plus zero.
But when including one of these three sets of variables, it is up to you to specify the taxpayer-spouse split. You will get an error message from Tax-Calculator, and it will stop running, if you do not split the filing-unit amount between taxpayer and spouse so that the above equations hold for each filing unit in the input file. Read this document for more details.

In addition to this earnings-splitting data-preparation issue, Tax-Calculator expects that the value of ordinary dividends (e00600) will be no less than the value of qualified dividends (e00650) for each filing unit. And it also expects that the value of total pension and annuity income (e01500) will be no less than the value of taxable pension and annuity income (e01700) for each filing unit. Again, it is your responsibility to prepare input data in a way that ensures these relationships are true for each filing unit.

Here's an example of how to specify a few stylized filing units with and without young children.

RECID,MARS,XTOT,EIC,n24,...
   11,   1,   1,  0,  0, ... <== single person with no kids
   12,   4,   2,  1,  1, ... <== single person with a young kid
   13,   2,   4,  2,  2, ... <== married couple with two young kids
Be sure to read the documentation of the MARS, XTOT, EIC, and n24 input variables. Also, there may be a need to add of child-age input variables if you want to simulate reforms like a child credit bonus for children under five years of age. Also, the universal basic income (UBI) reform is implemented using its own set of three age-count input variables.

Initiate Reform Analysis
The tc CLI to Tax-Calculator requires only an input file containing one or more filing units. A baseline file is optional; no baseline file implies the policy baseline is current-law policy. A policy reform file is optional; no reform file implies no reform (that is, you want to analyze current-law policy). An economic assumption file is also optional; no assumption file implies you want to conduct static analysis. The output files written by tc are built-up from the name of the input file, baseline file, reform file, and assumption file using a # character if the option is not specified.

Here we explain how to conduct tax analysis with the tc CLI by presenting a series of examples and explaining what output is produced in each example. There are several types of output that tc can generate so there will be more than a few examples. The examples are numbered in order to make it easier to refer to different examples. All the examples assume that the input file is test.csv, which was mentioned in previous part of this section.

(1)$ tc test.csv 2020
Example (1) produces a minimal output file containing 2020 tax liabilities for each filing unit assuming the income amounts in the input file are amounts for 2020 and assuming current-law tax policy projected to 2020. The name of the CSV-formatted output file is test-20-#-#-#.csv. The first # symbol indicates we did not specify a baseline file and the second # symbol indicates we did not specify a policy reform file and the third # symbol indicates we did not specify an economic assumption file. The variables included in the minimal output file include: RECID (of filing unit in the input file), YEAR (specified when executing tc CLI), WEIGHT (which is same as s006), INCTAX (which is same as iitax), LSTAX (which is same as lumpsum_tax) and PAYTAX (which is same as payroll_tax).

Also, documentation of the reform is always written to a text file ending in -doc.text, which in this example would be named test-20-#-#-#-doc.text.

(2)$ tc test.csv 2020 --dump
Example (2) produces a much more complete output file with the same name test-20-#-#-#.csv as the minimal output file produced in example (1). No other output is generated other than the test-20-#-#-#-doc.text file. The --dump option causes all the input variables (including the ones understood by Tax-Calculator but not included in test.csv, which are all zero) and all the output variables calculated by Tax-Calculator to be included in the output file. For a complete list of input variables, see the Input Variables section. For a complete list of output variables, see the Output Variables section. Since Tax-Calculator ignores variables in the input file that are not in the Input Variables section, the dump output file in example (2) can be used as an input file and it will produce exactly the same tax liabilities (apart from rounding errors of one or two cents) as in the original dump output.

This full dump output can be useful for debugging and is small when using just a few filing units as input. But when using large samples as input (for example, the cps.csv input file), the size of the dump output becomes quite large. For Tax-Calculator versions 0.15.0 and higher, there is a way to specify a partial dump that includes only variables of interest. To have tc do a partial dump, create a text file that lists the names of the variables to be included in the partial dump. You can put the varible names on separate lines and/or put several names on one line separated by spaces. Then point to that file using the --dvars option. So, for example, if your list of dump variables is in a file named mydumpvars, a partial dump file is created this way:

$ tc cps.csv 2020 --dump --dvars mydumpvars
If there is no --dvars option, the --dump option produces a full dump.
(3)$ tc test.csv 2020 --sqldb
Example (3) produces the same dump output as example (2) except that the dump output is written not to a CSV-formatted file, but to the dump table in an SQLite3 database file, which is called test-20-#-#-#.db in this example. Because the --dump option is not used in example (3), minimal output will be written to the test-20-#-#-#.csv file. Note that use of the --dvars option causes the contents of the database file to be a partial dump.

Pros and cons of putting dump output in a CSV file or an SQLite3 database table: The CSV file is almost twice as large as the database, but it can be easily imported into a wide range of statistical packages. The main advantage of the SQLite3 database is that the Anaconda Python distribution includes sqlite3 (or sqlite3.exe on Windows), a command-line tool that can be used to tabulate dump output using structured query language (SQL). SQL is a language that you use to specify the tabulation you want and the SQL database figures out the procedure for generating your tabulation and then executes that procedure; there is no computer programming involved. We will give an example of SQL tabulation of dump output in the next part of this section.

(4)$ tc test.csv 2020 --dump --sqldb
Example (4) shows that you can get dump output in the two different formats from a single tc run.

The remaining examples use neither the --dump nor the --sqldb option, and thus, produce minimal output for the reform. But either or both of those options could be used in all the subsequent examples to generate more complete output for the reform.

(5)$ tc test.csv 2021 --reform ref3.json
Example (5) produces 2021 output for the filing units in the test.csv file using the policy reform specified in the ref3.json file. Because no --assump option is used, the output results are produced using static analysis. The name of the output file in this example is test-21-#-ref3-#.csv.

If, in addition to ref3.json, there was a ref4.json reform file and analysis of the compound reform (consisting of first implementing the ref3.json reform relative to current-law policy and then implementing the ref4.json reform relative to the ref3.json reform) is desired, both reform files can be mentioned in the tc --reform option as follows:

$ tc test.csv 2021 --reform ref3.json+ref4.json
The above command generates an output file named test-21-#-ref3+ref4-#.csv
(6)$ tc test.csv 2021 --reform ref3.json --assump res1.json
Example (6) produces 2021 output for the filing units in the test.csv file using the policy reform specified in the ref3.json file and the economic assumptions specified in the res1.json file. The output results produced by this non-static analysis are written to the test-21-#-ref3-res1.csv file.

In the preceding examples, all the output files are written in the directory where the tc command was executed. If you want the output files to be written in a different directory, use the --outdir option. So, for example, you have created the myoutput directory as directory at the same level as the directory from where you are running tc, output files will be written there if you use the --outdir myoutput option.

The following examples illustrate output options that work only if each filing unit in the input file has a positive sampling weight (s006). So, we are going to use the cps.csv file in these examples along with the policy reform specified in the ref3.json file, the content of which is:

// ref3.json raises personal exemption amount to 8000 in 2022,
// after which it continues to be indexed to price inflation.
{
    "policy": {
        "_II_em": {"2022": [8000]}
    }
}
The output options illustrated in the following examples generate tables of the post-reform level and the reform-induced change in tax liability by income deciles as well as graphs of marginal and average tax rates and percentage change in aftertax income by income percentiles. These tables and graphs are meant to provide a quick glance at the impact of a reform. Any serious analysis of a reform will involve generating custom tables and graphs using partial dump output. One of many examples of this sort of custom analysis is here.

Example (7) produces 2022 static output for the filing units in the cps.csv file using the policy reform specified in the ref3.json file. Notice that Tax-Calculator knows to extrapolate (or age) filing unit data in the cps.csv file to the specified tax year. It knows to do that because of the special input file name cps.csv. The tables produced by this static analysis are written to the cps-22-#-ref3-#-tab.text file. Note that on Windows you would use dir instead of ls and type instead of cat.

Also note that the tables above in example (7) include in the bottom decile some filing units who have negative or zero expanded income in the baseline. If you want tables that somehow exclude those filing units, use the --dump option and tabulate your own tables.

(8)$ tc cps.csv 2024 --reform ref3.json --graphs
You loaded data for 2014.
Tax-Calculator startup automatically extrapolated your data to 2024.

Example (8) is like example (7) except we ask for 2024 static output and for graphs instead of tables, although we could ask for both. The HTML files containing the graphs can be viewed in your browser.

Here is what the average tax rate graph in cps-24-#-ref3-#-atr.html looks like.

There is yet another tc CLI output option that writes to the screen results from a normative welfare analysis of the specified policy reform. This --ceeu option produces experimental results that make sense only with input files that contain representative samples of the population such as the cps.csv file. The name of this option stands for certainty-equivalent expected utility. If you want to use this output option, you should read the commented Python source code for the ce_aftertax_expanded_income function in the taxcalc/utils.py file at the developer website.

None of the above examples use the --baseline option, which means that baseline policy in those examples is current-law policy. The following example shows how to use the --baseline option to engage in counter-factual historical analysis. Suppose we want to analyze what would have happened if some alternative to TCJA had been enacted in late 2017. To do this we need to have pre-TCJA policy be the baseline policy and we need to have the alternative reform be implemented relative to pre-TCJA policy. The following tc run does exactly that using a local copy of the 2017_law.json file and the alt_reform.json file containing the alternative reform defined relative to pre-TCJA law.

 (9)$ tc cps.csv 2019 --baseline 2017_law.json --reform 2017_law.json+alt_reform.json
You loaded data for 2014.
Tax-Calculator startup automatically extrapolated your data to 2019.
In all the examples in this section, we have executed one tc run at at time. But what if you want to execute many tc runs because you want results for many years and/or for several different reforms. Unless you are asking for full-dump output, a single tc run should take no more than one minute on your computer (even if you are using the large cps.csv input file). The easiest way to speed up the execution of many tc runs is to split them into groups of runs and execute each group of runs in a different command-prompt window. On most modern computers that have four CPU cores and a fast disk drive, executing four runs in different windows will take not much more time than executing a single tc run. If you have more than one run in each group, put them in a Unix/Mac bash script or a Windows batch file, and execute one script in each command-prompt window. If it still takes too long, consider splitting the tc runs across more than one computer.

Tabulate Reform Results
Given that tc CLI output can be written to either CSV-formatted files or SQLite3 database files, there is an enormous range of software tools that can be used to tabulate the output. You can use SAS or R, Stata or MATLAB, or even import output into a spreadsheet (but this would seem to be the least useful option). If you just want to compare the contents of two output files, you can use your favorite graphical diff program to view the two files side by side with highlighting of numbers that are different. The main point is to use a software tool that is available to you and that you have experience using.

Here we give some examples of using the sqlite3 command-line tool that is part of the Anaconda distribution (so it is always available when using Tax-Calculator). The first step, of course, is to use the --sqldb option when running tc. Then you can use the sqlite3 tool interactively or use it to execute SQL scripts you have saved in a text file. We'll provide examples of both those approaches. There are many online tutorials on the SQL select command; if you want to learn more, search the Internet.

First, we provide a simple example of using sqlite3 interactively. This approach is ideal for exploratory data analysis. Our example uses the cps.csv file as input, but you can do the following with the output from any input file that has weights (s006). Also, we specify no policy reform file, so the output is for current-law policy. What you cannot see from the following record of the analysis is that the sqlite3 tool keeps a command history, so pressing the up-arrow key will bring up the prior command for editing. This feature reduces substantially the amount of typing required to conduct exploratory data analysis.

$ tc cps.csv 2016 --sqldb
You loaded data for 2014.
Tax-Calculator startup automatically extrapolated your data to 2016.
$ sqlite3 cps-16-#-#-#.db
SQLite version 3.22.0 2018-01-22 18:45:57
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> YOUR FIRST SQL COMMAND GOES HERE
sqlite> YOUR SECOND SQL COMMAND GOES HERE
sqlite> ...
sqlite> YOUR FINAL SQL COMMAND GOES HERE
sqlite> .quit
$ 
Second, we provide a simple example of using sqlite3 with SQL commands stored in a text file. This approach is useful if you want to tabulate many different output files in the same way. This second example assumes that the first example has already been done. Note that on Windows you should replace cat with type.

$ cat tab.sql
-- tabulate unweighted and weighted number of filing units
select "unweighted count | weighted count (#m) of filing units";
select count(*),  -- unweighted count of filing units
       round(sum(s006)*1e-6,3) -- weighted count of filing units (#m)
from dump;

-- weighted count by filing status (MARS)
select "filing status (MARS) | weighted count of filing units";
select MARS, -- filing status
       round(sum(s006)*1e-6,3) -- weighted count of filing units (#m)
from dump
group by MARS;

-- tabulate weight of those with NEGATIVE marginal income tax rates
select "weighted count of those with NEGATIVE MTR";
select round(sum(s006)*1e-6,3) -- weighted count of filing units (#m)
from dump
where mtr_inctax < 0;

-- construct NON-NEGATIVE marginal income tax rate histogram with bin width 10
select "bin number | weighted count | mean NON-NEGATIVE MTR in bin";
select cast(round((mtr_inctax-5)/10) as int) as mtr_bin, -- histogram bin number
       round(sum(s006)*1e-6,3), -- weight count of filing units in bin (#m)
       -- weighted mean marginal income tax rate on taxpayer earnings in bin:
       round(sum(mtr_inctax*s006)/sum(s006),2)
from dump
where mtr_inctax >= 0 -- include only those with NON-NEGATIVE marginal tax rate
group by mtr_bin
order by mtr_bin;

$ cat tab.sql | sqlite3 cps-16-#-#-#.db
unweighted count | weighted count (#m) of filing units
456465|157.558
filing status (MARS) | weighted count of filing units
1|81.303
2|61.655
4|14.599
weighted count of those with NEGATIVE MTR
15.338
bin number | weighted count | mean NON-NEGATIVE MTR in bin
-1|26.649|0.0
0|2.484|7.17
1|60.493|14.14
2|38.317|25.55
3|13.159|32.26
4|0.988|43.15
5|0.113|55.53
6|0.016|66.75
The cat command writes the contents of the tab.sql file to stdout. We do nothing but that in the first command in order to show you the file contents. The second command pipes the contents of the tab.sql file into the sqlite3 tool, which executes the SQL statements and writes the tabulation results to stdout. (If you're wondering about the validity of those high marginal tax rates, rest assured that all filing units with marginal income tax rates greater than sixty percent have been checked by hand and are valid: most are caught in the rapid phase-out of non-refundable education credits or in the phase-in of taxation of social security benefits. The negative marginal tax rates are caused by refundable credits, primarily the earned income tax credit.)
If you want to use the sqlite3 tool to tabulate the changes caused by a reform, use the tc CLI to generate two database dump files (one for current-law policy and the other for your reform) and then use the SQLite3 ATTACH command to make both database files available in your SQLite tabulation session.

Upload Files to TaxBrain
Any policy reform or economic assumption files you can use with tc can be uploaded to trigger a TaxBrain run. As mentioned above the main advantages of doing this is getting access to the proprietary puf.csv input file, getting fast execution of both reform and current-law policy runs for ten years and getting the flexibility to specify a variety of distributional tables. All the TaxBrain results can be downloaded to your computer for storage or for additional analysis.

The files on your computer can be uploaded at the TaxBrain file-upload page.

An extended example of how preliminary tax analysis on your computer can be combined with TaxBrain file-uploading is here.

Assumption Parameters
This section contains documentation of several sets of parameters that characterize responses to a tax reform. Consumption parameters are used to compute marginal tax rates and to compute the consumption value of in-kind benefits. Growdiff parameters are used to specify baseline differences and/or reform responses in the annual rate of growth in economic variables. (Note that behavior parameters used to compute changes in input variables caused by a tax reform in a partial-equilibrium setting are not part of Tax-Calculator, but can be used via the Behavioral-Response behresp package in a Python script.)

All the assumption parameters can be used by the tc CLI, but only those with a TB Name appear in the TaxBrain GUI. All these assumption parameters control advanced features of Tax-Calculator, so understanding the source code that uses them is essential. Default values of most assumption parameters are zero and are projected into the future at that value, which implies no response to the reform. Using the default no-reform-response assumption for all the response parameters generates a static analysis of the tax reform. The benefit value consumption parameters have a default value of one, which implies the consumption value of the in-kind benefits is equal to the government cost of providing the benefits.
